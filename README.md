## "Alexa, can you handle big data?"
Using Google Colab, AWS RDS, PySpark, and SQL to extract, transform, and load Amazon review data into the cloud and then perform statistical analysis

Amazon review data for Video Games and Pet Products was extracted from S3 into individual Google Colab notebooks, transformed to the desired schema, and loaded into an RDS instance (Level 1). The data from the Pet Products reviews was then used to analyze whether or not Vine reviews are free of bias using SQL queries (Level 2).
